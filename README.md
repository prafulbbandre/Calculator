# CROSSCONVERTER
This is a simple crossconverter website

This will be used to calculate the difference between same component but different amount and price.

**E.g.**

Taking an example of **Vegetable oil Tin [13.650 liter]** and **Vegetable oil loose [1 liter].

Here suppose the Tin is listed at a price of **1720** and loose is listed at a price of **125**.

Here you are supposed to buy a product that is profitable (more product in less amount).

E.g.
This use simple maths conversions.
If 13.650 Liter of Oil cost 1720 then 1 liter of oil should cost **X**.  (Here **X** is used as variable)
or it can be like If 1 liter of oil cost 125 then how much should 13.650 cost.

**Mathematically**

For calculating the actual value of **Tin** with refrence to the **loose**.

If         1 = 125.

then  13.650 = **X**   
 
Calculating: **X** = 13.650 * 125;

Which is **X** =  1706.25 
 
 Which is less than 1720 So Here we must prefer to buy the loose one.
 
 
 Every product Nowdays come in small and large packs so it will be helpful in choosing the right one.
 
 Not everyone likes to Waste their money.
